"""Misalignment (policy axis) vs operating_gap (diagnostic axis).

★ The two axes must never be conflated ★
- `misalignment = speed_limit - v_safe` is the main axis: how far the
  *posted limit* sits above/below the safe speed. Positive means the limit
  is too high for who's exposed to this road -- the priority signal for
  "review this speed limit."
- `operating_gap = f85_speed - v_safe` is diagnostic only: whether traffic
  is *actually* travelling above the safe speed, i.e. whether enforcement
  or physical engineering (not just a sign change) is needed. It must never
  feed into the priority score itself (that is speedlimit_plausibility.py's
  responsibility, which this file deliberately avoids).

`misalignment_magnitude = max(0, misalignment)` isolates the "too high"
direction that drives priority (VRU protection is the point of this
challenge). The opposite direction (limit too low / possible
over-regulation) is kept as its own column, `excess_caution_magnitude`, and
is explicitly out of the priority axis (see PIPELINE.md §4).

Rows flagged `data_quality_flag=='invalid_speed'` (schema.has_invalid_zero_speeds)
have speed_limit/f85_speed values that are placeholder zeros, not real
measurements -- both axes are set to NA for them rather than computed, per
They must not leak into the misalignment scoring (see schema.py).
