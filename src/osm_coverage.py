"""Pedestrian-infrastructure coverage in sample urban/rural areas, plus a
feasibility test of buffering OSM crossings against road segments as a
VRU-exposure signal.

A zero/near-zero count in a rural sample does not prove "no sidewalk exists"
-- it may simply be unmapped. That ambiguity is the point of this check: it's
why image CV or population/POI density end up as the fallback signal instead
of trusting OSM pedestrian tags directly in rural areas.
