"""Split the priority list into two tracks by `speedlimit_plausibility`.

★ SpeedLimit is not ground truth (FAQ) ★
A segment can land in the priority list for two structurally different reasons:
- the posted SpeedLimit really is too high for who's exposed here
  (`speedlimit_plausibility == "high"`) -- a genuine policy review case.
- the *recorded* SpeedLimit itself looks unreliable
  (`speedlimit_plausibility == "low"`, an IQR outlier within its
  (country, road_class, land_use) peer group or >30km/h off observed
  speed -- see speedlimit_plausibility.py) -- the apparent misalignment may
  just be a bad record, not a bad speed limit.

These must not be merged into one list: a true-misalignment recommendation
diluted with sign-recording errors would undermine the credibility of the
whole priority list. `review_track` keeps them as two disjoint categories:
  - "Review Needed" (review the speed limit) -- plausible record, large gap.
  - "Field Verification Needed" (verify on the ground first) -- record itself is suspect.
Only segments already in the priority list (`priority_class` != "No Issue",
and excluding the `data_quality_flag` rows §0 already isolated) are
assigned a track; everything else is `pd.NA` -- this is a split of the
existing priority list, not a new filter.

`street_image_link` (despite its name, a "lon1,lat1,lon2,lat2" endpoint
string, not an image URL -- see schema.py) is carried through unchanged for
the "Field Verification Needed" track so each segment can be located for field/imagery
verification. Caveat that must travel with it: street-level imagery can
usually confirm LandUse/environment, but there's no guarantee the posted
speed-limit sign itself is visible or legible in frame -- it corroborates
context, not the SpeedLimit value.
