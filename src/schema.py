"""Common schema for Thailand and Maharashtra road-segment data.

The GeoJSON files (not the CSVs) are the canonical source: they carry the full
LineString geometry per segment, whereas the CSVs only carry a textual
StreetImageLink start/end-point string. Row order and OBJECTID are identical
between the GeoJSON and CSV exports for both countries, so either can be used
for attributes, but geometry is only in the GeoJSON.

`SpeedLimit` / `LandUse` are estimates, not ground truth, and observed speed
(`MedianSpeed` / `F85thPercentileSpeed`) is for diagnostics only -- neither is
used here to derive a target speed.
